//Class is used as a template for declaring and creating the objects. An object is an instance of a class.
//An instance field, in C#, is a variable of any type contained within a class or struct, and is used to store
//object data. It is a member of its containing type with one copy of the field for each instance of the containing type.
//Instance fields represent the data of a class that enables an object to maintain its state.
