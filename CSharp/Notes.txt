Note:- Csharp Learning by cmd :-
- For learning c# using cmd <- Create a Folder, Create a cs ext file(any) in folder. Enter folder's search location write cmd enter, opened cmd write csc file.cs enter, write file enter <- for converted file running on cmd, csc(C-sharp compiler)


(11)STATEMENTS, EXPRESSIONS AND OPERATORS IN C-SHARP
Statement is set of tasks that perform to achieve the overall functionality of a program.
- C# program contains multiple statements grouped in a blocks.
- Statement can consist of : Data types, Variables, Operators, constants, Literals. Keywords, Escape sequence etc
- Statements are classified into seven categories :- Selection, Iteration, Jump, Execution Handling Statements etc

expression vs statement in c#?
Expressions can be assigned or used as operands, while statements can only be declared.
Example:- simpleInterest = principal * time * rate/100; <- statment(simpleInterest = principal * time * rate/100;), principal(oprands(principal)) with Expression(principal * time * rate/100)

Operators:- Like Arithmatic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise, Conditional, Increment and Decrement Operators
Operators Categories into 3 Categories :- Unary, Binary, Ternary Operators
Unary Operators are worked with single operand

(62)What is the difference between reference variable and object of class in C#?
A reference type variable contains a reference to data stored in memory, also known as the heap. The heap is most often used for data that has a longer life. You can have more than one variable point to the same referenced data. Objects are an example of a reference type.

Compile Time vs runtime:- Compile time means error deduct in program on code writting time, runtime means error deduct after program execution

class member initialization time why required constructor in C#?
What is the need for initialization of object using constructor?
A class object with a constructor must be explicitly initialized or have a default constructor. Except for aggregate initialization, explicit initialization using a constructor is the only way to initialize non-static constant and reference class members

Be focus on Practicle only
---------------------------

Don't read only statements, write code and debug more means not read uppar-uppar se
Once practicle understand then theory easily to understandable automatically in C# or any programming language/topic etc.
